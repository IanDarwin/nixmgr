= nixmgr

The is the remains of a simple web-based User Management webapp for Unix. Meant to be part of a larger sysadmin project.
Originally done in Seam2; most pages still need translating to JSF2. 

Arguably not worth salvaging given the availability of RH Cockpit, Webmin, etc. Left here in case anyone wants to pick up the pieces.
