<!-- 
 This is the email that is sent to a user after the "forgotten
 password" processing is complete.
 
 An Email is a user-facing view object, so it
 logically belongs here in the view layer (our older SOFIA code
 had email text hard-coded in controllers as Java quoted strings -
 that's so unmaintainable!
 
 See Section 13.4 of Seam In Action for more details on Seam Email.
