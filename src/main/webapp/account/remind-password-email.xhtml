<!-- 
 This is the email that is sent to a user to ask them
 to authorize the "forgotten password" processing.

 An Email is a user-facing view object, so it
 logically belongs here in the view layer (our older SOFIA code
 had email text hard-coded in controllers as Java quoted strings -
 that's so unmaintainable!

 See Section 13.4 of Seam In Action for more details on Seam Email.

  <m:body type="plain">
Dear #{forgetful.name}:

Somebody has requested that the password for "#{forgetful.username}" be sent to the owner's email address.

Your account's password is '#{forgetful.password}'.

If you did not request a password change, you can just ignore this request, 
although it might mean that somebody is trying to access your account illicitly.

If you need further assistance, please contact the 
administrator, via admin@ernescliff.ca.
