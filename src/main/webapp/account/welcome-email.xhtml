<!-- 
  This is the email that is sent to a newly-registered user.
  
 An Email is a user-facing view object, so it
 logically belongs here in the view layer (our older SOFIA code
 had email text hard-coded in controllers as Java quoted strings -
 that's so unmaintainable!
 
 See Section 13.4 of Seam In Action for more details on Seam Email.

  <m:body type="plain">Dear #{accountHome.instance.name}:
As an inhabitant of Ernescliff Residence you are entitled to an account
on the UNIX server which can be used for logging in to our public Linux systems
and for printing from your own computer (see the local web site for
information on setting up your Windows or Mac printer, if you need help);
note that you must print via the server ('srv' at 192.168.100.1).

Below is the information on the new account. Please keep it for your records.
Username: #{accountHome.instance.username}
Password: #{accountHome.instance.password}

You can change your password and examine your print balance via the
"usermgmt" interface, at http://srv:8080/ (this assumes that you
have set 'srv' to be 192.168.100.1 in your hosts file (/etc/hosts
on Unix/Linux, hosts.txt somewhere under \windows\etc depending on
the Windows version).

Welcome to the site!
