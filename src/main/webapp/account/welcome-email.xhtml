<!-- 
  This is the email that is sent to a newly-registered user.
  
 An Email is a user-facing view object, so it
 logically belongs here in the view layer (our older SOFIA code
 had email text hard-coded in controllers as Java quoted strings -
 that's so unmaintainable!
 
 See Section 13.4 of Seam In Action for more details on Seam Email.
