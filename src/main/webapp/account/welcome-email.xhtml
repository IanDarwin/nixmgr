<!-- 
  This is the email that is sent to a newly-registered user.
  
 An Email is a user-facing view object, so it
 logically belongs here in the view layer (our older SOFIA code
 had email text hard-coded in controllers as Java quoted strings -
 that's so unmaintainable!
 
 See Section 13.4 of Seam In Action for more details on Seam Email.

You are receiving this email because an account has been created for you

This account can be used for logging in to our public Linux systems
and for printing from your own computer (see the local web site for
information on setting up your Windows or Mac printer, if you need help);
note that you must print via the server ('srv' at 192.168.100.1).

Below is your account information. Please keep it for your records.
Username: #{accountHome.instance.username}
Password: #{accountHome.instance.password}

You may want to change your password via the "usermgmt" interface,
at http://192.168.100.1:8080/.
