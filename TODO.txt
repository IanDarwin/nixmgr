TODO for 'usermgmt' accounting system
-------------------------------------

Run jboss under a more privsep account.

FIX insert failures!! (probably hibernate_sequence vs serial!!)

Button colors vanish @Ernescliff - why?

Write external code to merge from passwd file to db

Write re-create logic: if not accountCreated then add, else update.

LONG-RANGE
----------
Save passwords hashed in database, only clear when changing

Merge in "bugola" project (better, 
	provide a way to deploy 2 projects
	with singlesignon).

let users buy credit on visa/paypal?

UnixAccountAccessor - should later create account THEN run passwd, to make sure
it's done according to encryption specified in login.conf! For now works using -m.
