Remove extraneous jars from deployed-jars list?

Save passwords hashed in database, only clear when changing

Implement forgotten password logic?

Handle case where account is in db but not in passwd file (using pwent?)
	
Merge in "bugola" project (better, 
	provide a way to deploy 2 projects
	with singlesignon).
