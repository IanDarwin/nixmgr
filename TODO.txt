TODO for 'usermgmt' accounting system
-------------------------------------

UnixAccountAccessor - MUST create account THEN run passwd, to make sure
it's done according to encryption specified in login.conf!

Button colors vanish @Ernescliff - why?

Don't show ID on AccountEdit page

printcredits COMMENT #pages

Remove extraneous jars from deployed-jars list?

Save passwords hashed in database, only clear when changing

Implement forgotten password logic?

Read pwent (code in darwinsys) & merge with list in database?

Handle case where account is in db but not in passwd file (using pwent?)
	
Merge in "bugola" project (better, 
	provide a way to deploy 2 projects
	with singlesignon).
	
Long-range:
	let users buy credit on visa/paypal?
